**Employee Management System using Python and SQLite3**

**Description:**
This project is an Employee Management System built using Python and SQLite3. It allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on employee records. The system includes functionalities to add new employees, view existing employee details, update employee information, and delete employees from the database.

**Features:**
- Add new employees with their name, email, and department.
- View a list of all employees stored in the database.
- Update existing employee information such as name, email, and department.
- Delete employees from the database.

Step 1: Install Required Libraries
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you need to install the sqlite3 library, which is included in the Python standard library.

step 2: create database and table using sql
the code have been in the respositories.

step 3:Implement CRUD Operations
In this example, the add_employee() function adds a new employee to the database, the view_employees() function retrieves all employees, the update_employee() function updates an employee's information, and the delete_employee() function removes an employee from the database.

Please ensure to handle user input and exceptions appropriately in a real-world scenario to make the application robust and user-friendly. Additionally, you can create a user interface (using frameworks like Flask or Django) to interact with these functions for a more user-friendly experience.
